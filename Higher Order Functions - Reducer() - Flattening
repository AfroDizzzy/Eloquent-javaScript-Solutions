// task = Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays.


let arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]];
//none abstracted version using only the concat() method, but could be abstracted more

function Concatinator(array) {
  let newArray = [];
  for (let element of array) {
    newArray = newArray.concat(element);
    console.log(newArray);
  }
  return newArray;
}

Concatinator(arrays);

//abstracted solution using concat() and reduce() methods

function reducer(a, b) {
  return a.concat(b); 
}

console.log(arrays.reduce(reducer)); //reduce is a method avaliable for all arrays. It cycles through all elements of each array and preforms a function on the element, with the total output being stored as the "a" variable in the function.    
    
  
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
